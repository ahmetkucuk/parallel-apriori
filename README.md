Spark implementation of well-known apriori algorithm
=====================

This is a course project for parallel-algorithm class at GSU.

Apriori algorithm is used for frequent item-set mining, pattern mining etc. 

A Spark implementation and sequential implementation of the algorithm also included for comparison. 

Two different market item datasets are used for tests. 

Eventhough conversion between RDD to native scala data structure creates some overhead, algorithms achieve speed up.
